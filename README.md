### Inspiration

As developers, most of our time goes into searching stuff and finding out out the functions and syntax of a particular tech stack on the web, because let's face it, WE CANNOT REMEMBER THE SYNTAX OF EVERY LANGUAGE WE WORK IN!

What do we do when we need to google an error or find out the correct way to use a particular function? We paste our 'string' onto Google's search bar and then open up the top 5-6 search result on new tabs hoping to find the answers to our queries.

Sometimes, it may happen that we are reading some documentation and there comes a keyword/function in our way which needs to be understood to go further on understanding about what we initially were reading about! 

Now let's think this way, what if we provide you with a feature, where you can just highlight the text you want to search, right click and choose among various options on which platform you would like to find the answer to your question?

Yes you heard that right, Search-Tap let's you do that and helps you save a lot of searching seconds while you're in your develpoer mode. Not only when you're develpoing stuff, but this can be used by all the people wherever they want!

- A toggle button to serve search option to you on only those websites where you really want to
- A bookmark like feature to save some of your favourite websites which you might use daily or have to log on to on a daily basis for work!
